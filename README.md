Life as Someone Else

This was a UI/UX class project which I further developed outside of the class. This is a web application similar to Glassdoor. It is meant to help working professionals share about their personal view and experience on their jobs and to help others get a better idea of those jobs. The website is in a blogging format where users can choose to make a part of their posts private.

Initially, the project was created through multiple cycles of ideation, need-finding, prototyping, user-testing, and evaluation. After the class was over, I edited and added more codes for both front-end and back-end.
